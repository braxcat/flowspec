# GOAL

make sure that ALL things conform to 

# Claude:  https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices
(also should be able to be run "headless" with the -p option when given clear work)

make it work with all other coding agent tools

# https://agents.md/ - https://github.com/openai/agents.md

(this might mean duplication of agent markdown) also ensure its in the right formats for each tool. 


and those agents will need to work in the 

# inner-loop.md 
the local build

and the

# outer-loop.md
the SDLC / Promotion (CICD) process 

specific to the agent in question.

so the outer loop agents need to be able to work in github actions.
